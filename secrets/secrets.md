### 1) i'm just a dog (4:08)

> I’m just a dog \
> I’ll do anything for your love \
> I sit at the door \ 
> And wait for your arrival \ 
> Thinking about where you’ve gone \ 
> Wondering who is it that you want \ 
> You’re keeping me calm \
> But who am I when you’re gone \
> \
> Is it just me I’m waiting on \
> Is there somewhere I went wrong \
> Because I feel the same as I was \
> But all fucked up \
>  \
> I’m just a dog \
> I’ll do anything for your love \
> I keep by your side\
> And wash your tears when you cry\
> Thinking about where've been\
> Wondering what it is that I mean\
> I'm feeling let down\
> But you know I’ll stick around\
> \
> Is it just me I’m waiting on\
> Is there somewhere I went wrong\
> Because I feel the same as I was\
> But all fucked up\
> \
> When I start to go\
> Will I be on my own\
> When the lights go down\
> Will you still be around\
> \
> Is it just me I’m waiting on\
> Is there somewhere I went wrong\
> Because I feel the same as I was\
> But all fucked up\
> \
> I'm just a dog

### 2) once in a while (3:23)

> Feeling outgrown\
> I should've known\
> That once in a while\
> You'd light up my phone\
> \
> Feeling left out\
> Casting self doubt\
> But once in a while\
> I figure it out\
> \
> Felling let down\
> Drop into the ground\
> But Once in a while\
> You carry me out\
> \
> Wandering around\
> This labyrinth unfound\
> But once in a while\
> I find my way out\
>

### 3) idk what i'm looking for (3:45)

> I don't know what I'm looking for\
> Some days I stand at the door\
> Thinking about all the things\
> That could've been\
> And even more\
> Some days I stand near the light\
> Feel the heat on my skin \
> Something nice \
> It's keeping me up at night I don’t know why\
> \
> Maybe I’m caving in\
> To my soul from my skin\
> And right back out again\
> Maybe I'm losing it\
> \
> I don’t know what I’m looking for\
> Some days I stare at the floor\
> Thinking of all the ways\
> For it to cave\
> Swallow me whole\
> Some days I open the blinds\
> Listen close for a voice\
> No replies\
> It’s keeping me up at night I don’t know why\
> \
> Maybe I’m caving in\
> To my soul from my skin\
> And right back out again\
> Maybe I'm losing it\
> \
> In the morning\
> It will begin again\
> But right now it's different\
> It all falls to place\
>

### 4) don't feed the wolves (4:26)

> Don't feed the wolves\
> They're lying to you\
> \
> Don't give them hope\
> They're right before you\
> \
> Strangers are always the strangest at night\
> And out goes the light\
> \
> And I'm gonna love you with all of my might\
> It's too late to fight\
>

Parmesan Dreams was recorded pre-pandemic with Andrew Tachine (drums, percussion), Abe Nouri (keys), Will Smillie (vocals, guitar, bass). The band worked remotely over the course of several months, sending tracks back and forth, late at night, wring, getting feedback, iterating, the culmination leading to Parmesan Dreams' self-titled EP.
